Charity Matching DAO Smart Contract

Overview

The Charity Matching DAO Smart Contract is built on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity language.
It enables a decentralized donation system where user contributions to approved charities are matched from a DAO-managed treasury based on a configurable ratio.
This ensures greater impact for charitable giving while maintaining transparency and on-chain accountability.

‚ú® Features

DAO Treasury Management

Owner can fund the treasury (add-to-treasury) and withdraw in emergencies (emergency-withdraw).

Treasury balance is always tracked on-chain.

Charity Approval System

Only approved charities can receive donations.

Owner can add or remove charities dynamically.

Donation Matching

Donations are matched with treasury funds at a configurable matching ratio (default 1:1).

Per-donation match amounts are capped by max-match-per-donation.

Contract ensures treasury has enough funds before matching.

Transparency & Tracking

All donations, matches, and recipient totals are recorded on-chain.

History is stored per donor, per charity, per block.

Donor and charity totals can be queried at any time.

‚öôÔ∏è Example Flow

DAO Owner funds treasury with add-to-treasury.

DAO Owner approves a charity with approve-charity.

A donor calls donate-with-match charity amount.

Donation is sent directly to the charity.

DAO treasury matches part/all of the donation based on ratio.

State variables are updated, ensuring full transparency.

Donors and charities can check totals and history anytime via read-only queries.

üîí Security Considerations

Only the contract owner can:

Fund/withdraw treasury

Approve/remove charities

Change ratio & max match

Matching funds are only released if:

The charity is approved

The treasury has sufficient balance

Emergency withdraw is restricted to the owner.
